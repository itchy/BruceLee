Bruce Lee is a bot that is used to defeat the Enter the Matrix game on the Red Dirt Ruby Conference 2 website.

Many Thanks to Dan Lucraft and Jordan Byron for sharing their code and helping me with my first bot.

This bot uses Mechanize to do its botting...

You have to have a valid rdrc2 login (i.e. have attended to conference) to access the Enter the Matrix game, 
but anyone can view the leaderboard => http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/leaderboard

The gist of how to play the game as a human is commented in the top of the game.rb file.

***********   NOTE   *********************
  Their is a small chance your bot may loose a battle in the first few rounds, 
	if the enemy gets 0 DDD programs before your HP's increase above the damage done
	in the final round.  If this happens just run your bot again 


***********   BEFORE USING THIS BOT FOLLOW THESE STEPS  ******************
1 - make sure you can use your twitter username and password to log into RDRC2 website
2 - put your username and password into the twitter.yml file
3 - goto the game site and monitor what is happening (your session is stored by your login, so you can see what 
		your bot is doing, this is important ) http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/
4 - comment out game.rb lines 178 & 179		
		#  @agent.get("http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/encounter?move=HP")
    #  pick_opponet
    -- This will cause the bot to stop each time you level up.  It will prompt you to MAKE A DECISION
			-- pick improve HP the first two times it stops (This is done in your browser see __FILE__ line 15 #3)
			-- pick improve Attack next three times (Also done in your browser) 9 is a high as it can get
		-- after making the decision in your browser, restart the bot
5 - once your attack is +3
		uncomment lines 178 & 179
		@agent.get("http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/encounter?move=HP")
    pick_opponet
		-- this will cause bot to always select improve HP from Matz
6 - at this point, just let Bruce fight.  He should kick some serious back side.  Eventually the stack 
		will get too deep and cause the bot to crash - just restart your bot
		
7 - if you want to add the logic for when to pick attack and when to pick +HP, go for it
8 - Also once your HP is +14 you no longer need to run -- in theory I have not tested this
9 - If you keep up with these stated just remember to get them from the web site or write them to a file
    because the stack will get too deep and Bruce will crash, causing variables to get rest.
