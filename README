Bruce Lee is a bot that is used to defeat the Enter the Matrix game on the Red Dirt Ruby Conference 2 website.

Many Thanks to Dan Lucraft and Jordan Byron for sharing their code and helping me with my first bot.

This bot uses Mechanize to do its botting...

You have to have a valid rdrc2 login (i.e. have attended to conference) to access the Enter the Matrix game, 
but anyone can view the leaderboard => http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/leaderboard

The gist of how to play the game as a human is commented in the top of the game.rb file.

***********   NOTE   *********************
  Their is a small chance your bot may loose a battle in the first few rounds, 
	if the enemy gets 0 DDD programs before your HP's increase above the damage done
	in the final round.  If this happens just run your bot again 


***********   BEFORE USING THIS BOT FOLLOW THESE STEPS  ******************
1 - make sure you can use your twitter username and password to log into RDRC2 website
2 - put your username and password into the twitter.yml file
3 - goto the game site and monitor what is happening (your session is stored by your login, so you can see what 
		your bot is doing, this is important ) http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/
4 - game.rb line 142 - uncomment || statment - it should look like below
		if me.programs.empty? || (enemy.programs[0] && enemy.programs[0].count("A")==0)
		-- this allows the bot to win before it has extra HP's, but fails once the computer can get healing 
5 - comment out game.rb lines 178 & 179		
		#  @agent.get("http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/encounter?move=HP")
    #  pick_opponet
    -- This will cause the bot to stop each time you level up.  It will prompt you to MAKE A DECISION
			-- pick improve HP the first two times it stops (This is done in your browser see __FILE__ line 15 #3)
			-- pick improve Attack next three times (Also done in your browser) 9 is a high as it can get
		-- after making the decision in your browser, restart the bot
6 - once you have the option to pick healing from Matz, comment out || statement in line 143			
		if me.programs.empty? #|| (enemy.programs[0] && enemy.programs[0].count("A")==0)
		-- this compensates for the computer being able to select healing, now you just win by nature of
			 having increased HP's
7 - once your attack is +3 and step 6 has occured (notice, you will probably reach +3 attack before step 6)
		uncomment lines 178 & 179
		@agent.get("http://reddirtrubyconf.com/game/encounter?move=HP")
    pick_opponet
		-- this will cause bot to always select improve HP from Matz
8 - at this point, just let Bruce fight.  He should kick some serious back side.  Eventually the stack 
		will get too deep and cause the bot to crash - just restart your bot
